# Breast Cancer Prediction

This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at predicting breast cancer from diagnostic data. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, this project involves a Jupyter notebook that details the creation and optimization of a predictive model.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The project revolves around the analysis of breast cancer diagnostic data and employs machine learning techniques to predict outcomes. This includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation, all comprehensively presented in a Jupyter notebook.

## ðŸ“‹ Preliminary Information

To make the most of this project, the following steps and prerequisites are recommended:

### Prerequisites:

- Access to the breast cancer dataset. The dataset used here is structured as a CSV file containing patient diagnostic information.

### ðŸ›  Installation & Operation Guide

To engage with this project, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    Get the code:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:yourusername/BreastCancerPrediction.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```
    cd BreastCancerPrediction
    ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**:
    Ensure the dataset file (`breast_cancer_data.csv`) is placed in the project directory.

4. **Set Up Python Environment**:
    Create a Python virtual environment (Python must be installed):
    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

5. **Activate the Environment**:
    - **On Linux/MacOS**:
        ```
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    - **On Windows**:
        ```
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

6. **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the necessary Python packages:
    ```
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    Start the Jupyter Notebook to access the project:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```

8. **Explore the Notebook**:
    Navigate through the notebook, running cells to perform data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

9. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
    Follow the notebook to train and evaluate the predictive models.

10. **Interact with the Results**:
    Review the outputs, including the confusion matrix for the chosen model (SVM classifier in this case).

    > Note: Use `python3` instead of `python` if you are on a Unix system.
